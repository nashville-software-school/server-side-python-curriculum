# Book 1 Reflections

This is truly a self-assessment, as you will need to reflect on what you learned in this project and collect your thoughts on the following questions. Part of becoming a high-value software developer is understanding key concepts... not just the ability pattern match and write code.

When you are done reflecting on these topics and feel that you have a solid understanding of each one, reach out to an instructor for a vocabulary review to ensure you are prepared for technical interviews.

## Object-Oriented Programming Reflection Questions

### Classes

- What is the purpose of a class in object-oriented programming (OOP)?
- How does defining a class differ from instantiating an object of that class?

### Python Packages

- What are the benefits of packages when developing Python projects?

## Python and SQL Reflections

## `if` Statements

2. Do I understand how to use `elif` and `else` in conjunction with `if`?
3. What is the difference between using `==` and `is` / `is not` with an `if` statement?
4. How would I check to see if a dictionary had a key with an `if` statement?

## `for` Loops

1. Can I write a `for` loop to iterate over elements in a list or tuple?

## Functions

1. Am I able to define and call a function in Python?
2. Do I understand the concepts of function arguments and return values?
3. Can I describe the technical difference between a method and a function?
4. What do I need to do to invoke a function that is defined in a different module?

## Modules

1. Can I explain what a Python module is and why it is useful?
2. Do I know how to import and use functions from a module?

## Data Structures

1. Can I create, modify, and access elements in a Python list?
1. If I was asked in an interview to describe a dictionary, what would I say?
3. Do I understand how to access and modify values based on keys in a dictionary?
1. Do I know the difference between an object and a dictionary in Python?
4. What can an object do that a dictionary can't?

## Try/Except

1. Can I explain the purpose of a `try/except` block in Python?

## HTTP Response Codes

1. When a server throws an unexpected exception, which status code should I send to the client in the response?
2. If the client requested a supported resource that doesn't exist, what status code should be part of the response meta-data?
3. If the client did not send all of the required data in the payload of the request, what status code should be part of the response meta-data?
4. If the client tries to perform an action _(GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE)_ that isn't supported by the API, what status code should be part of the response meta-data?

## SQL

1. Can I explain what SQL is and why it is used in software development?
1. Am I able to write a basic SQL query to select a single record from a database table?
1. Can I construct a SQL query to join two tables and select multiple records?
1. Am I capable of using the `WHERE` clause to filter records in a SQL query?
2. Do I understand how to combine `WHERE` with other SQL clauses like `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`?
