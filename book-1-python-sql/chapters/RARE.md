# Rare Publishing Platform Notes

Our client, Rare Publishing, needs a new application built for their readers. Currently, readers can submit new articles through the mail and once month Rare sends out a Zine of articles that the publishers liked the most. They've finally decided that the internet is not a fad and want a new way for readers view posts.

The finished application will give users the ability to submit, update and comment on posts. The posts will also be organized by tags and categories making it easier for the reader to find the posts they are searching for.

The previous dev team was able to complete the client and server side portions of login and register. It is up to you to complete the remaining tickets. It is also up to you to decide how many of those tickets you will complete in the first sprint.

Take a few hours to look over the remaining tickets, ERD, and wireframes. Think about what needs to be completed on the server and client side for each ticket to be considered "Done". Write any notes you might have for each ticket as needed in github and ask any clarifying questions you have.

Once you have an idea of how many tickets your group can complete this sprint let your Product Manager know.

# Setup

## Project Directories

You'll be working in two separate repos for the project. One for the client and one for the server. One person will create the repos using github classroom. Then, everyone will do the following:

1. Create a directory that will hold both github repos. For example, `~/workspace/python/rare`.
2. `cd` to that directory.
3. Clone the client and server side repos into this folder.

## Constraints for Vanilla Python Rare

* You are not going to worry about admin users for this first sprint. Assume all users are authors.
* Since there are no admins, posts should be automatically published and not wait for approval.

## ERD

The database development team has already taken a stab at the [ERD for this project](https://drawsql.app/nss-2/diagrams/rare-v1). You will use this to start building the project.
