# Expanding Orders With SQL

Currently, your order JSON in a response to a client looks like this.

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "timestamp": 1614659931693,
    "style_id": 3,
    "metal_id": 3,
    "size_id": 2
}
```

The goal is to have the related information expanded and embedded in the JSON so that the client doesn't have to perform multiple `fetch()` calls to get the metal, style, and size.

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "timestamp": 1614659931693,
    "style_id": 3,
    "style": {
        "style": "Vintage",
        "price": 965
    },
    "metal_id": 3,
    "metal": {
        "metal": "24K Gold",
        "price": 1258.9
    },
    "size_id": 2,
    "size": {
        "carets": 0.75,
        "price": 782
    }
}
```

Since the JSON is generated by serializing an instance of the **`Order`** class, that means you need to add new properties to your class. Add three new properties to **`Order`**, but with an initial value of `None`.

```py
class Order():

    def __init__(self, id, timestamp, style_id, metal_id, size_id):
        self.timestamp = timestamp
        self.style_id = style_id
        self.metal_id = metal_id
        self.size_id = size_id
        self.style = None
        self.metal = None
        self.size = None
```

## Joining the Three Related Tables

You are going to practice the `JOIN` process in SQL for this solution.

Now you can join the `Location` table into the query so that the name and address fields are in the results. Put the following SQL in your `kennel.sql` file and run it. You should see the results displayed below.

#### SQL

Update the existing SQL in the `get_all_orders()` function to join in the 3 related tables, and select all required columns from those tables. Here's some SQL to get you started.

```sql
SELECT
    o.timestamp,
    o.size_id,
    o.style_id,
    o.metal_id,
    m.metal,
    m.price
    -- You select the rest of the columns from the joined tables here
FROM `Order` o
JOIN Metals m ON m.id = o.metal_id
-- You write the rest of the JOIN clauses here
```

## Creating Extended Order Instances

Update your logic for creating an Order instance to include the size, style, and metal. Here's some starter code.

```py
for row in dataset:

    # Create an order instance from the current row
    order = Order(row['timestamp'], row['metal_id'], row['style_id'], row['size_id'])

    # Create a Size instance from the current row

    # Create a Style instance from the current row

    # Create a Size instance from the current row

    # Add the dictionary representation of related object to the order instance
    # Here what added the size would look like. You add the other two.
    order.size = size.__dict__

    # Add the dictionary representation of the order to the list
    orders.append(order.__dict__)
```
