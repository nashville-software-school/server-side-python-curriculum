# Rare Publishing Platform Notes

Our client, Rare Publishing, needs a new application built for their readers. Currently, readers can submit new articles through the mail and once month Rare sends out a Zine of articles that the publishers liked the most. They've finally decided that the internet is not a fad and want a new way for readers view posts.

The finished application will give users the ability to submit, update and comment on posts. The posts will also be organized by tags and categories making it easier for the reader to find the posts they are searching for.

The previous dev team was able to complete the client and server side portions of login and register. It is up to you to complete the remaining tickets. It is also up to you to decide how many of those tickets you will complete in the first sprint.

# MVP
## Back End (Server) Setup and Instructions
One person create the repo on Github from the link provided in the curriculum. Then, everyone will do the following:

1. Create a directory that will hold the github repo. For example, `~/workspace/python/rare`.
2. `cd` to that directory.
3. Clone the server side repo into this folder. (Later, when you have completed the server side, you will clone the client into this same directory)
4. Once cloned, follow the instructions in each readme has instructions to get the starter code set up.

## Constraints for Vanilla Python Rare

* You are not going to worry about admin users for this first sprint. Assume all users are authors.
* Since there are no admins, posts should be automatically published and not wait for approval.
* No image uploads for user profile or post

## ERD

The database development team has already taken a stab at the [ERD for this project](https://drawsql.app/nss-2/diagrams/rare-v1). You will use this to start building the project.

1. Take a few hours to look over erd. Think about what needs to be completed on the server side for each ticket to be considered "Done".
2. Write any notes you might have for each ticket as needed in github and ask any clarifying questions you have.
3. Create a plan, issue tickets, milestones and/or a project board with all the work you plan to complete as a team
4. Ensure that you have detailed user stories and acceptance criteria on each ticket
5. Once you have an idea of how many tickets your group can complete this sprint let your Product Manager know.

Feel free to reference the tickets from the [client side project](https://github.com/nss-evening-web-development/rare-client-nextjs/issues) to help

  ## Front End (Client) Setup and Instructions
  The same person who created the BE repo on Github, create the FE repo. Then, everyone will do the following:

  1. Create a directory that will hold both github repos. For example, `~/workspace/python/rare`.
  2. `cd` to that directory.
  3. Clone the client side repo into this folder.
  4. Once cloned, follow the instructions in each readme has instructions to get the starter code set up.
  
  ## The work
  1. Take a few hours to look over tickets and wireframe. Think about what needs to be completed on the client side for each ticket to be considered "Done".
  2. Write any notes you might have for each ticket as needed in github and ask any clarifying questions you have.
  3. Create a plan, milestones and/or a project board with all the work you plan to complete as a team
  4. Once you have an idea of how many tickets your group can complete this sprint let your Product Manager know.
