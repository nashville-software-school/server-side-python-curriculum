# Learning SQL with Chinook

## Setup

### Downloading the Database File

Follow the link below and click the "Download" button when you get there.

[Chinook Database](./data/Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite)

### Move Database to Workspace

1. In your CLI, get to the directory where you extracted the archive. It should be something like the following.
    ```sh
    cd ~/Downloads
    ```

1. Create a directory for your work.

    ```sh
    mkdir -p ~/workspace/chinook
    ```

2. Move the `Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite` file to that directory

    ```sh
    cp Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite ~/workspace/chinook
    ```

That file **is** the database. It contains all of the tables and data. Open that directory in VS Code and create a connection to the database file.

## Instructions

### Public Repo
In your cohort's Github account, create a repository for your answers. Name your repository `chinook-{your Github username]`.

### ERD

Create an ERD of the Chinook database with dbdiagram.io. Make sure to label primary keys, foreign keys, and indicate the type of relationship (one to one, one to many, many to many, etc) for each relationship.

### Exercises

For each of the following exercises, provide the appropriate query. Yes, even the ones that are expressed in the form of questions. Everything from class and the [Sqlite Documentation](http://www.sqlite.org/) is fair game. Create the file specified and write the query for that problem in that file.

When you believe you have it solved, add/commit/push to your Github repo.
