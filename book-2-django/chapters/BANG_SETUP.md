2. [Visit the generation page](https://github.com/new?template_name=bangazon-api&template_owner=nss-group-projects) for the API repository.
3. In the **Owner** dropdown, choose your cohort organization, not your personal account.
4. In the **Repository name** field enter **Bangazon API {team name}**. Do not put curly braces there, just your team name.
5. Click the **Create repository** button and wait for the repository to be created.
6. Follow the steps [to clone an existing repository](https://nashville-software-school.github.io/github-workflow/) and create the `develop` branch.

### Adding your teammates

1. Visit the Github repo and click on **Settings**.
2. Click on **Collaborators** on the left.
3.  Add your teammates.
4.  Share the URL to the repo with your team.

## 2. Joining as a collaborator

Everyone else can now visit the URL and accept the invitation. Then follow the steps in the [clone an existing repository](https://nashville-software-school.github.io/github-workflow/) Github Workflow Guide.

## 3. Generate the client repository

Follow the exact same steps for the client repository. Visit the [generation page](https://github.com/new?template_name=bangazon-client&template_owner=nss-group-projects) to get started.

## 4. Get your backlog the project
