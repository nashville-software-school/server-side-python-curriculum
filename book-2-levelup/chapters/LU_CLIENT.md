# Level Up React Client

You are going to start this project with a basic React client for gamers to use to create accounts, register games, schedule events, and join/leave events created by other gamers.

Visit the [Level Up NextJS Template](https://github.com/codetracker-learning/TEMPLATE-nextjs-withauth-django) Github repository and click on the "Use this template" button to generate a repository in your own Github account.

Once the generation process is complete, clone the repository down to a directory of your choosing inside your `~/workspace` directory.

Once cloned, make sure to follow the README to set up the client project with Firebase Auth.

Everything should work if you see this error pop up:
