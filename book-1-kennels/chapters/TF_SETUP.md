# Debugging Python

As a professional junior developer, you will more often be working with existing code to fix bugs, write tests, and implement small features. You will rarely be involved with writing new applications from scratch. To give you some experience with that situation, you are going to be fixing four bugs in an existing Python API project.

## Getting the Project

When you are ready to take on this project, let your senior instructor know. You will be given a Github Classroom link that you can click to get a repository of code that you will be working on.

The other project in the client application. You won't be fixing anything in this code base. In fact, you should not modify the code at all. You need this project running, though, to see if your bug fixes are correct.
