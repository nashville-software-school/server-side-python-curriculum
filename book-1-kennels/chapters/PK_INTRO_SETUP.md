# Replacing Firebase Realtime Database with Python

Oh no! The developer of `json-server` decided he didn't want to share his code any longer. This really stinks because all of your local project development was completely dependent on it to be the storage of your persistent data, and allowed you to request the data via `fetch()` calls.

Luckily, you know you have Python installed on your computer and you found a snippet of code on Stack Overflow that lets you start up your own, basic service that listens for HTTP requests on port 8088 - just like `json-server` did - and responds with data.

By the end of this book, you will be able to write a server application that responds to HTTP requests from a react application.

## Learning Objectives

1. You should be able to explain what an HTTP status code is.
1. You should be able to explain the purpose of a 200 status code.
1. You should be able to explain the purpose of a 201 status code.
1. You should be able to explain the purpose of HTTP headers.
1. You should be able to identify a Python function.
1. You should be able to identify a Python `if` block.
1. You should be able to identify a Python list.
1. You should be able to identify a Python dictionary.
1. You should be able to explain the purpose and action of a Python `print()` function.
1. You should be able to explain that whitespace (i.e. indentation) defines scope in Python instead of `{}`.

## Directory and Code Setup

```sh
mkdir -p ~/workspace/kennels-server
cd ~/workspace/kennels-server
touch request_handler.py
curl -L -s 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/master/Python.gitignore' > .gitignore
```

### Supporting 3rd Party Software

Now you are going to install two tools:

1. **autopep8** - This is an auto formatter that follows the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide. This will be installed globally, so you won't have to install this again.
    * Run: `python3 -m pip install autopep8`
3. **pylint** - This is a linter that shows any lint errors in your code. This will be installed locally within the pipenv environment (more on this later). For every new project you'll need to install pylint into each one.
    * Run: `pipenv install pylint`

Then, start a virtual environment. Virtual environments ensure that libraries installed for a project don't pollute the entire operating system. It keeps everything contained to the project.

```sh
pipenv shell
```

### Writing your first Python module

We need to set up our server to handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). The following code sets up the beginning of our server to handle the GET, POST, and PUT methods by including methods called `do_GET`, `do_POST`, and `do_PUT`. Copy pasta the following code into the `request_handler.py` file. Read the comments to get a feel for what each method is doing. Make your own comments for any questions you have about what the code is doing.

```py
import json
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer


# Here's a class. It inherits from another class.
# For now, think of a class as a container for functions that
# work together for a common purpose. In this case, that
# common purpose is to respond to HTTP requests from a client.
class HandleRequests(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    # This is a Docstring it should be at the beginning of all classes and functions
    # It gives a description of the class or function
    """Controls the functionality of any GET, PUT, POST, DELETE requests to the server
    """

    # Here's a class function

    # Here's a method on the class that overrides the parent's method.
    # It handles any GET request.
    def do_GET(self):
        """Handles GET requests to the server
        """
        # Set the response code to 'Ok'
        self._set_headers(200)

        # Your new console.log() that outputs to the terminal
        print(self.path)

        # It's an if..else statement
        if self.path == "/animals":
            # In Python, this is a list of dictionaries
            # In JavaScript, you would call it an array of objects
            response = [
                {"id": 1, "name": "Snickers", "species": "Dog"},
                {"id": 2, "name": "Lenny", "species": "Cat"}
            ]

        else:
            response = []

        # Send a JSON formatted string as a response
        self.wfile.write(json.dumps(response).encode())

    # Here's a method on the class that overrides the parent's method.
    # It handles any POST request.
    def do_POST(self):
        """Handles POST requests to the server"""

        # Set response code to 'Created'
        self._set_headers(201)

        content_len = int(self.headers.get('content-length', 0))
        post_body = self.rfile.read(content_len)
        response = { "payload": post_body }
        self.wfile.write(json.dumps(response).encode())

    # A method that handles any PUT request.
    def do_PUT(self):
        """Handles PUT requests to the server"""
        self.do_PUT()

    def _set_headers(self, status):
        # Notice this Docstring also includes information about the arguments passed to the function
        """Sets the status code, Content-Type and Access-Control-Allow-Origin
        headers on the response

        Args:
            status (number): the status code to return to the front end
        """
        self.send_response(status)
        self.send_header('Content-type', 'application/json')
        self.send_header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*')
        self.end_headers()

    # Another method! This supports requests with the OPTIONS verb.
    def do_OPTIONS(self):
        """Sets the options headers
        """
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*')
        self.send_header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE')
        self.send_header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept')
        self.end_headers()


# This function is not inside the class. It is the starting
# point of this application.
def main():
    """Starts the server on port 8088 using the HandleRequests class
    """
    host = ''
    port = 8088
    HTTPServer((host, port), HandleRequests).serve_forever()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

## Adjust VS Code Settings
First you'll need to select the correct Python Interpreter. Open the command palette with `cmd+shift+p` and select "Python: Select Interpretor". Find the option that has `<your folder name>-<random string>`

Open the command palette again and search for "Open User Settings (JSON)". Add these to the bottom of the file, updating the autopep8Path to be the output of `which autopep8`

```
"python.formatting.autopep8Path": "paste in the output from the which command",
"python.linting.pylintEnabled": true,
"python.analysis.diagnosticSeverityOverrides": {
  "reportGeneralTypeIssues": "none"
}
```

With pylint enabled we need to control some of the warnings that VS Code will warn about. We can do this by creating a `.pylintrc` file. Copy this command into the terminal to create the file:
```
echo '[FORMAT]
good-names=i,
    j,
    ex,
    pk,
    id,
    do_PUT,
    do_POST,
    do_OPTIONS,
    do_GET,
    do_DELETE

[MESSAGES CONTROL]
disable=broad-except,redefined-builtin,missing-module-docstring
' > .pylintrc
```
If you press `opt-shift-f` while the `request_handler.py` file is active, some code should change to conform to PEP 8 standards

## Running the Server with VS Code Debugger

First we'll need to tell VS Code how to start the server. If there isn't a `.vscode` folder already create one now. Inside the `.vscode` folder create a file called `launch.json`. Paste in the following code
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Request Handler",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "./request_handler.py",
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            "autoReload": {
                "enable": true
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
Since the `request_handler.py` file has the code to run the server, this tells VS Code to run that file when using the debugger.
To run the debugger, click the "Run and Debug" button on the far left nav column (should be 4th button down). Then click the green play button beside "Request Handler". Once the terminal opens you can move on to the next step. We'll go over adding breakpoints in class.

## Requesting Animals via Postman

If you haven't already, download [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/). Now open Postman and request http://localhost:8088/animals and see what the `kennels-server` responds with. You should get an array of two animal objects.
