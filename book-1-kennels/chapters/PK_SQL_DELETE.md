# Deleting Animals from the Database

The `DELETE` SQL statement does exactly what you would expect... it deletes rows. In modern applications that expose resources at URL endpoints, the ability to delete all items in a table is never provided. What you provide is the ability to delete a single row.

The syntax for this function is far simpler since you are not requesting information from the database and converting that data to animal instances.

You just fire and forget.

```py
def delete_animal(id):
    with sqlite3.connect("./kennel.db") as conn:
        db_cursor = conn.cursor()

        db_cursor.execute("""
        DELETE FROM animal
        WHERE id = ?
        """, (id, ))

```

## Delete Using Postman

1. From the Postman client, perform a DELETE request to http://localhost:8088/animals/5
1. Then request all animals again with a GET request to http://localhost:8088/animals
1. Verify that the animal with an id of 5 is not in the response and got deleted from the database.

## Adding the Animal Back

In relational database systems, primary keys are never reused. If an animal has an `id` of 5, and you delete that row from the database, then insert the exact same data again with an INSERT INTO statement, the `id` that will be generated by the database will be 6 for the new row.

Try it now.

Go back to your `kennel.sql` file and run the insert statement for Daps.

```sql
INSERT INTO `Animal` VALUES (null, "Daps", "Kennel", "Boxer", 2, 2);
```

Then request all animals from Postman, and note that the `id` value for Daps is now 6 instead of 5.
