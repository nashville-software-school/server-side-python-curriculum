# Level Up React Client

You are going to start this project with a basic React client for gamers to use to create accounts, register games, schedule events, and join/leave events created by other gamers.

Visit the [Level Up NextJS Template](https://github.com/codetracker-learning/TEMPLATE-nextjs-withauth-django) Github repository and click on the "Use this template" button to generate a repository in your own Github account.

Once the generation process is complete, clone the repository down to a directory of your choosing inside your `~/workspace` directory.

Once cloned, make sure to follow the README to set up the client project with Firebase Auth.

You should see the login screen on load, but when you login you should see this error:

Don't worry, this should be happening. This will get fixed when you add authentication to your server.
