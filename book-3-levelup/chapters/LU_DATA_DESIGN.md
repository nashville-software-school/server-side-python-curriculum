# Carrie's Level Up Requirements

## Meeting Carrie

> Carrie is sitting at the table by the front window of the Cat CafÃ© where she wanted to meet and discuss the "program" she wants you to write for her.
>
> She has a grey cat sitting in her lap, which she gently holds in one arm as she takes a sip of her coffee
>
> You greet her and say, "It's a pleasure to meet you, Carrie. What a lovely cat!"
>
> She replies, "I'm glad to meet you, too. This is Gentry. He needed some attention this morning, so I decided to bring him with me." She starts to pet his back and tail with her hand.
>
> You eagerly say, "I'm excited to hear what you want me to build for you. I enjoy playing games, too. Mostly video games."
>
> Carrie tilts her head slightly, "I've tried a couple of those but haven't gotten the hang of it. What I'm looking for is a way for people to gather and play card games and board games."
>
> "My cat, Sheen," she continues, "likes to play games with me, but nothing quite as complex as Settlers of Catan or Bridge." Her face brightens a bit as she talks about how she tries to get her cats to play games with her.
>
> "One time, I even put catnip on some checkers and tried to see if Checkers, my other cat, could move the piece to play with me. It didn't really work." She laughs lightly, obviously playing the scenario out in her mind.
>
> You also laugh at the idea of a cat playing checkers, and ask, "Can you tell me what you're looking for in the application you want me to build for you?"


>
> "Of course, dear!"
>
> You take your pen out and open your notebook ready to furiously scribble notes.
>
> "I want a way to schedule events for people to play games."
>
> You make a quick note, and then look up at her expectantly, waiting for more information.
>
> Carrie smiles a bit, and blinks, thinking she gave you all the information you need.
>
> "Um, ok. Well... what games can people make events for? Any game?"
>
> "I was thinking card games and board games," she replies.
>
> You press on with, "But any one of those games, right?"
>
> "Well, of course, dear. I'm not against learning a new game. As long as I'm meeting people and having fun."
>
> Realizing the client doesn't quite know how to describe how the app will work, you ask some more questions, "Ok, so people can create any game they want. Got it. So... who schedules an event? The person who creates the game, or anyone who wants to play the game?"
>
> Carrie looks to the side for a moment to think and replies, "I think anyone should be able to schedule an event for any game that has been added."
>
> You write more notes.
>
> "Oh!" she exclaims quickly, "and I want people to say if they are coming. That way the person holding the event knows how many people to expect. It's only proper."
>
> You ask, "And anyone can sign up for any event?"
>
> "The more the merrier, dear." She looks down at Gentry, and continues, "Just like with my cats. The more the merrier."
>
> You finish writing your notes, smile, and say, "I think I have all I need to get an initial version for you to see and give me feedback. It was so lovely to meet you, Carrie."
>
> She stands with Gentry, and replies, "Lovely to meet you as well. I can't wait to share it with my knitting and book clubs. We've all been trying to branch out a little."
>
> You reply, "That's great! I'll let you know when I'm done with the first version and we can schedule a time to meet again."
>

## Learning Objectives

* You should be able to create an ERD based on verbal requirements from a non-technical customer.
* You should be able to design a Django database model class based on the table definition in your ERD.
* You should be able to explain the process of using Django commands to get your models turned into database tables.
* You should be able to predict how a database table should be structured given a Django model.
* You should be able to clarify the difference between a one-to-many relationship and a one-to-one relationship.

## ERD

* There will be 5 main tables, `Gamer`, `Game`, `GameType`, `EventGamer` and `Event`.
* Each of those tables have some fields that would be useful to keep track of in the database.
* The `Game` table will have a one to many relationship with `GameType` since a game will be associated with 1 game type and a game type can be associated with many games.
* The `Game` will also have a one to many relationship with `Gamer` because gamers can create more than one game.
* The `Event` table will have a one to many relationship with `Gamer`, called the organizer, because gamers can host many events but an event will only have 1 host.
* To keep track of who is attending events, there is a many to many relationship between gamers and events. There will need to be a join table to connect that many to many relationship. That's where the `EventGamer` table comes in.

After thinking about the requirements, you've come up with an erd.

[![Level Up ERD](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31781724/202056277-f58221cd-e076-41d1-b083-36cc5525b2a4.png)](https://drawsql.app/teams/trinity-christiana-terry/diagrams/level-up/embed)

## Design Models

Now that the application has been configured correctly, it's time to start designing your database. In Django, you use model classes instead of writing `CREATE TABLE` SQL statements.

Here is a quick example.

Imagine that you want to create a table in your database to store information about toys. These toys have a few properties.

* Color
* Price
* Material
* Name
* Toy Type

In SQL, you would write the following SQL statement to create the table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE `Toy` (
 `id`     INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
 `name`     TEXT NOT NULL,
 `material` TEXT NOT NULL,
 `color`  TEXT NOT NULL,
 `price`  FLOAT NOT NULL,
    `toy_type_id`      INT NOT NULL
);
```

Django can do that for you without ever needing to write SQL. You write classes that act as database models. You even get to leave out the `id` field. Django will add that automatically.

> *Here's the Django Docs on other field types: <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#field-types>*

```py
from django.db import models
from .type import Type

class Toy(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=55)
    material = models.CharField(max_length=55)
    color = models.CharField(max_length=12)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_length=7,decimal_places=2)
    toy_type = models.ForeignKey(Type, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

__Notice for the toy_type field, there's no need to put `_id` for the foreign key. Django will do that for you when the table is created__

## Application User (Gamer) Model

In this application, you are going to ask each Gamer to provide a short bio when they register. You need to create a __`Gamer`__ model with that field on it so that we can attach that bio to the right gamer.

Since we are using Firebase Authentication, we will use the uid we get back from it as our gamer uid. We'll get into how we're going to pass this from the frontend later. This needs to be a field on our __`Gamer`__ model as well.

> ### `levelup-server/levelupapi/models/gamer.py`

```py
from django.db import models


class Gamer(models.Model):

    uid = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    bio = models.CharField(max_length=50)
```

Then import your Gamer model into the package initialization module.

> ### `levelup-server/levelupapi/models/__init__.py`

```py
from .gamer import Gamer
```

> *NOTE: Every model you create must be imported into this package init module.*

* [One to Many Relationships](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/models/#many-to-one-relationships) - How to add a foreign key to a model

## Level Up Models

Once you have looked over the ERD and understand relationships for Gamers, Games, and Events, create your modules and classes. Then import the classes into the package init module.

There is a many-many relationship between the Gamers and Events to show who is attending an event. Read the [ForeignKey](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ForeignKey) resource to learn how to set up the Join EventGamer model.

## Migration of Models

__Once you have defined your models, you should review them with an instructor, or a teammate who has had their's approved.__

When your models are approved, you can then create a migration to create the tables in your database.

```sh
python manage.py makemigrations levelupapi
```

Now that migrations are created, run the following command to execute your migrations and create the tables in your database.

```sh
python manage.py migrate
```

You should now have a `db.sqlite3` file in the project folder. Make a connection to the database with SQLite Explorer to see the tables in the database.
