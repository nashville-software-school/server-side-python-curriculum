# Favameal: Favorite Restaurants

Visit the [Favameal Github template repository](https://github.com/nashville-software-school/favameal-django-template) and follow the setup steps. You will inherit some pre-written code, so you don't need to start from scratch.

This project allows you to focus completely on custom actions and custom model properties.

Your first challenge is to get the "Favorite a Restaurant" feature implemented. Review that section of the repository's README and see if you can use custom Model properties and custom ViewSet action methods to complete that feature.
