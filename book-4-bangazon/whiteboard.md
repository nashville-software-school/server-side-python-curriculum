## Whiteboard Problems
These exercises will test your knowledge of python fundamentals and increase your problem solving skills. If you're not sure where to start on a problem
write out comments for yourself for steps you think you'll need then start coding. If something isn't clear to you, ask your instructors questions to clarify the requirements. 

Whiteboarding isn't necessarily about solving the problem, it's about the steps you take along the way. Don't worry too much if you get stuck and make sure you ask for help when you need it. 

Also, there is no "right" way. There may be a cleaner, dry-er, or more pythonic way to solve the problem but it's ok to save the refactoring for after you solve it the first time.

Each challenge includes test code so you can check your work. To run the tests: 
1. Install pytest `pip3 install -U pytest`
2. `cd` into the folder with the test and run `pytest <file-name>.py` to see the test results
